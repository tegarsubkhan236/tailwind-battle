# Tailwind Battle Solutions

Welcome to the **Tailwind Battle Solutions** repository! ðŸŽ¨

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges on [Tailwind Battle](https://www.tailwindbattle.com/), a website where you can sharpen your Tailwind skills by solving fun and creative coding challenges.

## About TailwindBattle

[Tailwind Battle](https://tailwindbattle.com/) is a platform for Tailwind lovers to challenge their skills by replicating target images with the least possible Tailwind code. The goal is to match the target image as closely as possible using only HTML and Tailwind.

## Repository Structure

Each battle's solution is stored in a separate folder named after the battle. Within each folder, you will find:

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML and Tailwind code for the challenge.
- **screenshot.png**: A screenshot of my solution.
